RefreshWallpaper is a command line tool used to refresh the Windows Wallpaper.
It was created to override the company's group policy which prevents us to change corporate wallpaper.

Only JPEG images are supported right now.

Usage:
------
RefreshWallpaper.exe "c:\foo\my_image.jpg"
RefreshWallpaper.exe "c:\My Images Folder\"

The second option will display a random image from the folder.
